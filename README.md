# Bank Marketing Dataset
This project focuses on preparing and analyzing the [Bank Marketing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/janiobachmann/bank-marketing-dataset/data) using **Python**, **DuckDB**, and **Pandas**.

## Objective

- Normalizing the data using **DuckDB** SQL queries.
- Creating an **optimized schema** split into logical entities (customer and campaign).
- Adding **synthetic features** that improve analysis.
- Exporting the transformed data into **Parquet format** for efficient storage.
- Generating insights with **data visualizations**.
